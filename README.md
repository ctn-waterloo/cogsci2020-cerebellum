## About the code

The code in this repository is the exact codebase used to produce the results presented in the paper. To re-run the experiments, please make sure that a version of [NengoBio](https://github.com/astoeckel/nengo-bio) from the beginning of February 2020 is installed.

The code to execute and visualise the experiments can be found in the `notebooks` folder, the model itself is located in the `model` folder.
